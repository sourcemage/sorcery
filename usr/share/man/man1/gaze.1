.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I gaze
is part of the sorcery source-based package management suite. It is a
general purpose command-line tool for displaying package logs, version 
information, checking for installed packages, checksums, message digests,
maintainer information, package URL information, removing obsolete packages,
displaying new packages, untracked files, sections, searching for files that
are installed, finding when spells were created and packages in the
software catalogue. It can even take and retrieve snap shots of currently
installed packages for easy duplication.
