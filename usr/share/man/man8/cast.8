.TH CAST 8 "2010-08-13" "Source Mage GNU/Linux" "System Administration"
.SH NAME
cast \- installs software packages
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcast\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIpackage\fP ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B cast
is part of the
.B sorcery
package management suite. It is a command\-line tool for
automatically retrieving, unpacking, compiling, installing, and tracking
software installations.  In order to find a package (known as a
\fBspell\fP) to cast, refer to
.BR gaze (1)
and
.BR scribe (8)\.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS \fB\-b\fP, \fB\-\-force\-base\-dep\fP
Force all spells to depend on sorcery base spell (used internally).

.SS \fB\-B\fP, \fB\-\-recast\-up\fP
Recasts all the spells that depend on the given spell(s) (and the ones
they depend on ...).
.I \-c
may be specified to make sure they are recompiled and not resurrected.

.SS \-c, \-\-compile
Compiles the spell even if there is a binary cache in
.IR /var/cache/sorcery .
Otherwise, it would just resurrect (untar) it.  Helpful when the system
configuration changes.

.\" Next line: Do not wrap.  Formatting makes it reallllly long.
.SS \fB\-\-cflags\fP, \fB\-\-cxxflags\fP, \fB\-\-ldflags\fP, \fB\-\-cppflags\fP '\fIflags\fP'
Set custom compiler and linker flag values to be appended to those found in
the arch specs and those set through the sorcery menu.

.SS \-d, \-\-download
Forces redownloading of sources, even if they exist in the source cache
directory.

.SS \-\-deps
Determines dependencies for the given spell(s) and casts the
dependencies, but does not cast the given spell(s) itself.

.SS \fB\-\-from\fP \fIdirectory\fP
Specify a directory to look for cached sources in instead of
the default
.IR /var/spool/sorcery .
For further use it is usually easier to just copy the sources there though.

.SS \fB\-g\fP, \fB\-\-grimoire\fP \fIgrimoire\fP
.ns
.SS \fB\-g\fP, \fB\-\-grimoire\fP '\fIgrimoire\fP ...'
Use only the specified grimoires for this cast.

.BR IMPORTANT:
If there are any
cross\-grimoire dependencies on unspecified grimoires, then they will
not work, and the target spell will not be found. To avoid this, specify
all relevant grimoires to the option in the order to be searched.

.SS \fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP, \fB\-\-uhh\fP
Display the short help.

.SS \fB\-\-no\-opts\fP
Disables the use of optimization flags from the arch specs and the sorcery
menu, using none or only those specified on the command line with
\fI\-\-cflags\fP,
\fI\-\-cxxflags\fP, or \fI\-\-ldflags\fP.

.SS \fB\-O\fP, \fB\-\-recast\-optional always|ask-yes|ask-no|never\fP
If a spell being built has spells which could optionally depend on it,
but those dependencies are disabled, ask to recast these dependees. The
default option can be set via the sorcery menu. Implies
.IR \-c .

.SS \fB\-\-queue\fP
Casts all the spells in the install queue, as generated for example by
.BI sorcery " queue"

.SS \fB\-r, \-\-reconfigure\fP
This will make cast prompt again for optional dependencies and configuration
options. For those that have been answered before, the default will be the
previous value. This implies
.IR \-c .

.SS \fB\-R, \-\-recast\-down\fP
Recasts all the spells the given spell(s) depend on (and the ones they
depend on ...). It suggested to combine this option with
.IR \-c
in order to avoid resurrection instead of compilation. This may recast
a lot of spells.

.SS \fB\-s\fP
First download all spells, then cast.  Normal cast behavior is to
download in the background while compiling.  This disables that
behavior.

.SS \fB\-V on|off\fP
Overrides the VOYEUR option, which specifies whether or not the compile
output should be displayed. Helpful if it is usually off and it is
needed for troubleshooting.

.SS \fB\-Z\fP, \fB\-\-lazy\-updates always|ask-yes|ask-no|never\fP
Performs updates on the installed dependencies of spells to be cast.
The default option can be set via the sorcery menu.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The environment is set using the sorcery configuration files. See
.BR sorcery_config (8).
.IP
.SH NOTES
Do not include
.SM version
or
.SM section
name when specifying a package. \fBgaze\fP can provide a catalog of
both. Refer to
.BR gaze (1)
for such functionality.
.P
If spell fails during a cast, try recasting it with
.I cast \-r
to reconfigure and recompile.
.P
Unless the
.I \-\-from
option is specified,
.B cast
will always check the
.I /var/spool/sorcery
directory first to see if the package exists. If the package does not
exist it downloads the package via the Internet.
