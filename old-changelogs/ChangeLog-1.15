	* common, libmisc: moved the notice and failure log functions to

	  not available at this point (rightly so) #14197

2008-08-27 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>

	  It does not remove the failed spells dependencies yet

2008-08-26 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>

	  made two variables explicitly local

2008-08-25 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>

2008-08-23 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>

	* gaze: made gaze search not display duplicates

	* confmeld: make sure the config stage dir exists

2008-08-08 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libtablet: fixed a coalescing regression #14618
	  follow symbolic links when searching for the grimoire

2008-07-21 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libdispel: never fail when trying to remove the spell from the queue

2008-07-20 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libunpack: fixed the case in three messages
	* libtrack: fixed the case in two messages

2008-07-18 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libapi: fixed a wrong function name in the starting comment
	* gaze, gaze.1: gaze install can accept an optional version now; before
	  it always took the installed one, which doesn't work for dispelled
	  spells, even though their logs possibly still exist
	* libtablet: shortcircuit tablet_check_version_cache if the old queuing
	  method is used
	* dispel, libdispel, common, cleanse, libcast, libtriggers: fixed bug
	  #14575 - manually dispelling removes the spell from the install queue
	  most internal calls pass a flag to disable that behaviour
	* libqueue: fixed pop_queue to not create the queue if it doesn't exist
	* sorcery: properly check for empty files in *_execute()

2008-07-07 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libcast: removed extraneus spaces in acquire_cast_lock messages

2008-07-05 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libqueue: made the old method print all the reasons for queuing. This
	  way the behaviour is consistent with the new method and multiversioned
	  spells have all the reasons printed
	* libstage: install the rest of the files first, so any leading directories
	  the configs need get properly created; renamed stage_install_rest to
	  stage_install_ordinary
	  fixed a regression that caused us not to install excluded configs #14339
	* libstate: removed three unused variable definitions
	* libtime, gaze: factored out a pretty_print_time function and improved it
	  to not show 0 parts and incorporated the fix_zero_time in it
	  made use of pretty_print_time in other parts of the code
	  made compute_mean also compute the estimation error, adapted libtime and
	  gaze to it and removed an extraneous space from pretty_print_time
	  also compute and print the total error
	* libtime: removed the now unused fix_zero_time and epoch_to_hm functions
	  only print time pairs of the same version in compute_cast_times

2008-07-04 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libmisc: removed older, commented-out versions of config_[gs]et_option

2008-06-27 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* gaze: added time-system, which calculates the time the current system
	  took to build and install, based on each spell's timings. Can take a
	  --no-orphans parameter and type parameters like gaze time

2008-06-25 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libtime: added to hold functions dealing with time calculations
	  fixed a comment with a new insight
	  added weighted mean mode where the last version's timing counts 10 times
	  added compute_all_cast_times for use in gaze and two helper functions
	  display the spell name in front of each timing in quiet mode
	* gaze: added gaze time which shows the casting time of spells
	  added time --full, which prints all the casting times we can compute
	  made time use the new helpers, fixed (big) total display and changed
	  the quiet output to print seconds
	  removed two useless checks in the awk time printer
	* libsorcery: in verify_source print "failure" instead of the
	  unusual "failed"

2008-06-21 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libqueue: reformatted push_queue and cleaned up pop_queue
	  formatting, coloring and spelling fixes in install_queue_history
	* libsorcery, scribe: moved a newline from get_new_changes to 2/3 callers

2008-06-20 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libsorcery: refactored common code out of queueing functions and made
	  does_spell_need_update use the cache method too (a big cast -Z speedup)
	* libqueue: created to hold all the install queue functions
	  print the number of security updates for multiversion spells too
	  removed the unused build_install_queue() which is largely a duplicate of
	  list_install_queue()

2008-06-19 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* sorcery.8: clarify the sorcery default subcommands with examples #14528
	* libsorcery: use the new fast method in sorcery queue-security too
	  fixed held spells getting queued in the old compatibility mode

2008-06-18 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* config: made the rest of the previously overridable variables overridable
	  added missing file handling to the color() hack
	* libsorcery: increment the counter before drawing the progress bar
	* libtablet: only hardlink files if they're not already hardlinked when
	  coalescing the tablet
	* cast, summon, vcast, libapi, libmisc: removed --url remnants #14525
	  If you want to download from a different location, use summon --raw

2008-06-17 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* sorcery_config.5: clarify what the internal_version is for
	* libtablet: sped up tablet_coalesce_files to take a third of the time
	  append to the link_log, don't overwrite it each time
	  increment the counter before drawing the progress bar - this way it will
	  reach 100%
	* cleanse: call tablet_coalesce_files with $BACKUPDIR, so the log isn't
	  discarded right away

2008-06-16 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libstate: change modify_config to store values into variables in a manner
	  that is overridable from the environment (var=${var:-value}) #14454
	* sorcery: store COLOR in LOCAL_MEDIA_CONFIG, so there are no problems with
	  ordering when sourcing our libraries
	* config: source LOCAL_CONFIG before everything else; added a temporary
	  color() override to make the switch for the user
	* compile_config, media, roots, url: accompanying change
	  to benefit you must convert your local configs to the new system (ex.):
	  sed -i 's,^\(\s*\)\([^=]*\)=\(.*\),\1\2=${\2:-\3},' /etc/sorcery/config

2008-06-07 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libcodex: fixed an ancient minibug in codex_check_cache - the error
	  message was printing the wrong variable
	* sorcery: removed a useless variable, a relic from the days when sorcery
	  was a spell itself

2008-05-31 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* build: fixed a typo in the pwd error message
	* libsorcery: added a hidden switch disabling the new queing method
	  (mainly for reference)
	* libstate: fixed a typo in the search_spell_status description

2008-05-18 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* config: use $HOME instead of hardcoding /root

2008-05-14 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libtablet: made tablet_create_version_cache logically simpler

2008-04-29 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>

2008-04-28 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libresurrect: fixed ordering of the version cache addition
	* libgpg: fixed case in an error message

2008-04-26 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libcast: made the optional dependency on xinetd suggested and changed two
	  comments

2008-04-25 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libmisc: rewrote smgl_dirname using an explode approach for it to conform
	  to the system dirname (it was failing the unit tests for dirs like /etc
	  and //)
	  fixed smgl_basename not giving the correct result for /
	* common: moved the version cache addition in run_spell_success to before
	  the addition of the spell to the SPELL_STATUS to avoid a false failure
	  in tablet_check_version_cache

2008-04-23 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libstate: made get_all_spells_with_status accept "ok" as a parameter too
	* libtablet: added a check to tablet_check_version_cache to make sure that
	  it is also in a good state, not just there

2008-04-22 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libtablet: improved the error message in tablet_create_version_cache and
	  made it remove the partial cache on error

2008-04-20 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libsorcery: simplified a loop in save_binaries
	  fixed a typo in yesterday's change
	* run_compiler: use the normal dirname and basename, since it doesn't have
	  the full sorcery environment

2008-04-19 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* sorcery: sanitized the saving of CCACHE in the feature_menu
	  fixed CCACHE and STORE_CONF_LOG not being disablable
	  rewrote feature_menu to be much more concise and removed the extra
	  variable fallbacks, since most are already in the sorcery config
	  improved printing of the grimoire changelog
	  fixed broken symlink handling in save_libraries
	* config: added defaults for COLOR, CONFIG_LOC and GATHER_DOCS
	* scribe: fixed case in scribe update message
	* *: use smgl versions of basename and dirname

2008-04-18 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libsorcery: don't clear the line on every queuing progress bar update

2008-04-17 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libsorcery: made verbose queuing use the version cache too and now all
	  the reasons are displayed, not just the first (only in the cache code)
	  readded the progress bar, but only to the slow part of the queuing
	  removed an extra space in list_install_queue
	  reformatted and sanitized list_install_queue
	  also add held spells to the (tablet) version cache
	  don't queue held spells in either verbosity mode

2008-04-16 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* scribe.8: don't mention local grimoires for reindex-version, nothing good
	  can come of it
	* libdepends: when falling back to installed spells as default choices for
	  providers, try to use the currently used provider; added a warning
	* libcast: made run_conflicts query in QUERY_COLOR
	* libsorcery: removed a use of hardcoded $INSTALL_CACHE
	  change tee to sed p in clean_logs, it didn't work nicely for Vlad

2008-04-15 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* state: added VERSION_STATUS=${STATE_DIRECTORY}/versions
	* libtablet: added tablet_{create,check}_version_cache for creating a
	  cache of installed spells' queuing factors - the system variant of
	  scribe reindex-version; allows for a great speedup in sorcery queue
	* libstate: added remove_version_cache and add_version_cache for keeping
	  the tablet version cache up to date

2008-04-14 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libunpack: removed one of the parameters to uncompress_unpack and
	  made it pass on possible hints to uncompress/unpack;
	  changed unpack_core to allow for perserving permissions and owners;
	  uncompress_unpack_cache now requests the above via a hint

2008-04-13 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* gaze: don't show find errors when searching for aliens

	* config: added VERBOSE_QUEUING=on

2008-04-11 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>

	* config: defined VERSION_INDEX_FILE

2008-04-11 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libressurect: always use the saved version after setting the spell
	* libsorcery: rewrote log_list to conform with sorcery standards and be 50
	  times faster; made it also echo castfs logs and echo absolute paths
	  rewrote clean_logs to be more slick and as a result a lot faster
	  formatting and "localisation" fixes to activity_log

2008-04-10 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libressurect, libgpg: fixed some comments and error messages
	* libressurect: fallback to the variable's contents, not its name if the
	  current variable is empty/unset
	* sustained: added some missing basesystem entries and removed the now
	  nonexistant util-linux-crypto
	* libgpg: fixed gpg_verify_grimoire not liking versioned grimoires #13461

2008-04-08 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libtrack: added find_cache, a function similar to guess_filename for
	  finding caches from part of their name
	  added construct_cache_name which currently just appends $ARCHIVEBIN
	  modified create_cache_archive to be more generic
	* alter, dispel, common: use the new functions to be more abstract; now
	  caches created with a different compressor than the current work too
	* libunpack: added optional params to unpack_uncompress and a wrapper for
	  caches uncompress_unpack_cache
	* libressurect: fixed can_resurrect to accept other extensions
	  made ressurect use the new unpack_uncompress wrapper
	* libsorcery: made spell_recover use ressurect
	  set_compression_type now distinguishes between compressors and archivers;
	  tar is now saved to ARCHIVEBIN, EXTENSION holds the compressed extension
	* config: added a default for ARCHIVEBIN
	* api2: preserve the return status in run_pre_install
	* all this was part of bug #14218, FIXMEs and planned support for other
	  compressors and archivers

2008-04-02 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libcodex: added codex_find_spell_provides which prints the features
	  the spell is a provider of
	* libdepends: added support for recasting of spells that have a disabled
	  dependency on a feature which the cast spell is a provider of. Part of
	  private_recast_optionals
	  fixed formatting of the previous change
	* libstate: changed a regex in toggle_depends_status to be more general
	  added change_spell_provider for silently changing and toggling providers

	* libunpack: fixed typos in two comments

2008-03-31 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libmisc: added an esc_provider_str function for queries that look for
	  spells that provide the provider, where the initial .* should not be
	  escaped. This was broken since esc_str became consistent on 2008-03-26
	* libstate: use esc_provider_str for the second argument in the
	  search_depends_status* functions
	  added a toggle_depends_status for toggling dependencies on/off

2008-03-30 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libstate: added a workaround to search_depends_status_exact for provider
	  functions, since they were broke after the 2008-03-26 esc_str fix
	* common: check if the iw log exists before using it in run_spell_succes
	* libtrack: reformatted exists() and made it use a local variable
	* libgrimoire: dereference the deaddir in rm_source_dir #14399

2008-03-28 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>

	  Lipnevich #8521
	* libgrimoire: real_rm_source_dir: use local variables and a simpler loop
	* gaze, gaze.1: added size -all, initial patch from Danilo Vidovic #13556
	* url_git_local: added an url handler for local git urls, patch by Andraž
	  Levstik #14397; fixed the comments and removed the netselect function

	* libsorcery: deprecated dirnames() for get_dirnames() in libmisc
	  cleaned up guess_filename

	  them use the faster internal smgl_dirname and smgl_basename respectively
	* libdispel, libmisc: fixed the only three callers to use get_dirnames
	* common: cleaned up install_pam_confs
	* libdepends: use real_list_find in private_should_cast instead of forking
	  fixed the check if spell is held in real_sub_depends and improved the msg
	  use real_list_find in private_up_trigger
	  use real_list_find in work_{,optional_}depends_provider
	  fixed private_upward_depends matching spells too loosely
	  use real_list_find in private_run_depends
	  use real_list_find everywhere else
	  fixed real_show_up_depends showing false positives
	* libcodex: silence the unused codex_remove_duplicates with real_list_find
	* applied a modified patch from Arvid Norlander, which mainly changes uses
	  of hash_get to has_get_ref, removes double evaluations and improves some
	  formatting
	* dl_wget, liburl, url_http: use real_list_find instead of echo | grep -q
	* libmisc: fixed esc_str not escaping strings starting with .
	* cleanse: cleanse_fix_ldd_check: use hash_get_ref, don't do the lookup
	  twice and trick wc
	* dispel, libstate: use hash_get_ref some more
	* config: revert the recent addition of STAGED_INSTALL, so
	  is_castfs_installed gets a chance to be run

2008-03-25 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* libsorcery: reformatted the files, directories and symlinks functions and
	  made their variable local
	  then did the same for dirnames
	* config: added STAGED_INSTALL default and added DEBUG to the unstaged list

	* grimoire.5, libcodex, libtablet: made BUILD_API=2 the default
	* libmisc: simplified and sped up is_sorcery_var
	* dispel: made downgrading more user friendly #11749; now a list of
	  possible versions is displayed to choose from and the version
	  doesn't need to be specified on the commandline anymore
	* scribe: scribe index now also shows VERSION of grimoires #14233

2008-03-24 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* Start 1.15 development stream.
